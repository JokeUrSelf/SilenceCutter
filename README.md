### How to use

`import` the mp3/mp4 file to the program using "import" button and adjust the volume with a slider.
The segments quieter than the selected volume will be removed from the track.
Select the desired output format and hit `render`. You will be prompted to select the file path of the output file.

Now wait for the end of render.
