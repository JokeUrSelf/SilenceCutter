To use, simply `import` the mp3/mp4 file and adjust the slider to the lower volume.
Parts that are quieter than the selected volume are going to be removed from the track. 
Select the desired output format and hit `render`.

You will be prompted to select the file path of the output file.
Now wait for the end of render.
